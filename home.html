    Tek Dhakal was born in Bhutan, but due to religious and cultural conflict in his country, his family fled when he was about a year old and he spend the next 16 years in a refugee camp in Nepal. In 2009, Tek and his family moved to Louisville, Kentucky where he started school in the 10th grade. After high school, he enrolled at the University of Louisville where he received a B.A. degree in mathematics. </p>
        
<p>
Tek knew he wanted to pursue an advanced degree in Mathematics and he also wanted to have new experiences away from a large city, yet he wanted to be close to family.  He visited EKU and his experience was a very positive one.  He was offered a graduate assistantship in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, so in 2017 he moved to Richmond to begin his pursuit for a master’s degree in Mathematics.  As a graduate assistant, he was assigned to teach MAT 090 and MAT 095.  He is currently assisting with MAT 112 and also tutors in the Math tutoring lab.</p>

<p>
Tek’s thesis research, under the supervision of Dr. Jeffrey Neugebauer, is titled: Positive symmetric solutions of a boundary value problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions.</p>
        
<p> 
Dr. Lisa Kay, professor of statistics at EKU, comments, “It has been a pleasure serving as Tek’s graduate advisor.  His positive attitude is contagious – no doubt his presence has had an impact on his classmates and instructors.”</p>
        
<p>
When asked what he has learned while attending EKU, Tek remarks, “That is a hard question.  Before attending EKU, I didn’t work closely with faculty or students.  I’ve learned how to work as a member of a team.  I am considering becoming a teacher and the ‘real-life’ experiences I have received here will help me achieve that goal.  They have also helped me to become a more social person.”</p>
        
<p>
Tek has two younger brothers, Manorath and Chuda, who still live in Louisville.  Manorath will graduate from the University of Louisville with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Computer Engineering in December.  Chuda attends Jefferson Community and Technical College and also plans to pursue a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Computer Engineering at The University of Louisville.</p>
        
<p>
Upon finishing his master’s degree in December of 2018, Tek plans to continue in a Ph.D. program at either the University of Toledo or the University of Mississippi.  He hopes to one day become a professor or a computer programmer.</p>
